### Format reference genome to fix length
Did you need to generate a custom reference genome? You can use one of these tools to reformat your custom reference genome such that each line contains 60 nt.  
From the FATSX-toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/).  
- **search "FASTA Width formatter"** on usegalaxy.org (recommended 60 nt width)
